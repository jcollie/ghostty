//! Kitty drag and drop protocol (OSC 72).
//!
//! Specification: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/dnd-protocol/
//!
//! The protocol lets a program running in the terminal participate in
//! native OS drag and drop in both directions:
//!
//!   * Drops: a client registers to accept drops (t=a); the terminal
//!     then forwards native drag movement (t=m) and drops (t=M) to it
//!     and serves the dropped data on request (t=r), instead of the
//!     traditional behavior of pasting dropped paths or text. See
//!     `DropTarget`.
//!   * Drags: a client enables offering drags (t=o:x=1); when the user
//!     starts a drag gesture over the terminal, the terminal asks the
//!     client to offer one (t=o), and the client supplies the MIME
//!     types, data, and images of a native drag it starts (t=p, t=P)
//!     and the data a drop target requests during it (t=e). See
//!     `DragSource`.
//!
//! The embedder connects the protocol to the OS: `handleCommand`
//! processes client commands and returns `Event`s saying what changed,
//! which `dropEvent` and `dragEvents` turn into protocol independent
//! `terminal.dnd` events, and the embedder reports native activity with
//! `dropInput` and `dragInput` (or the `DropTarget` and `DragSource`
//! functions of `State` directly).
//!
//! ## Divergences
//!
//! These are on purpose forever:
//!
//!   * The embedder reads the files a client on another machine copies
//!     from a drop (t=r with y or Y keys), as file requests, and writes
//!     the files a client on another machine drags (t=k), where kitty
//!     does both itself: libghostty-vt doesn't touch the filesystem.
//!
//!   * A repeated text/uri-list request replaces the list that file
//!     requests index, where kitty appends to it.
//!
//!   * Responses echo the requesting command's terminator (ST or BEL)
//!     per ghostty convention; kitty always uses ST. Terminal-
//!     initiated events always use ST.
//!   * Drag images are passed to the embedder as received (RGB is
//!     expanded to RGBA): PNG decoding and rendering text images are
//!     the embedder's job, since they need its image and font support.
//!   * Drag data requested after the drag started is buffered in memory
//!     for the embedder to take, up to `max_buffered_bytes` unread,
//!     where kitty spools it to a temporary file.
